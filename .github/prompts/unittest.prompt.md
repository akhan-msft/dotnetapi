## Testing
- Generate unit tests using NUnit with proper Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Please generate NUnit tests using the constraint-based Assert.That syntax (e.g., Assert.That(actual, Is.EqualTo(expected))) and ensure compatibility with NUnit 3.x
- Use Moq for mocking dependencies in tests
- Use an in-memory database for database related unit tests
- Write tests that validate one behavior at a time with clear assertions
- Use test data builders or factory methods for complex test arrangements
